- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sarah-Englehart
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all that I can and getting helpful feedback from the community.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to become a Data Analyst after deciding I wanted to switch careers.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun facts: I have two black cats, Luna and Dianna. I am a red-seal certified chef, but I decided I needed a career change. I love playing video games, making cosplays, and crochetting, really anything craftsy!
